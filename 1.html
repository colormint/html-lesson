  According to one legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people
  in a region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were the first to recognize
  the energizing effect of the coffee plant.
  However, no direct evidence that has been found earlier
  than the 15th century indicating who among the African populations
  used it as a stimulant, or where coffee was first cultivated.
  The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered
  coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became after eating
  the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671
  and is probably apocryphal.
