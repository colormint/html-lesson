<h2>Variety</h2>
<p>
  Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from which coffee is extracted.
  The two main species commercially cultivated are Coffea canephora (predominantly a form known as 'robusta')
   and C. arabica. C. arabica, the most highly regarded species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia
  and the Boma Plateau in southeastern Sudan and Mount Marsabit in northern Kenya. C. canephora is native to western and central Subsaharan Africa,
  from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan. Less popular species are C. liberica, C. stenophylla, C. mauritiana, and C. racemosa.
